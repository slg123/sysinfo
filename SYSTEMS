# FILE    :  SYSTEMS
# PURPOSE : Used by the build and install scripts to determine
#          what systems should be built/installed.
# NOTES   : Any line that starts with a '#' is a comment so
#          you can easily comment out systems you don't want
#          to build.
#
# RECORD FORMAT:
# host;build-path;SecPath;AM_source_dir;ToBeBuilt;taz_name;taz_file_ostype;taz_file_osdir
#   host = host on which the build is to be performed
#   build-path = directory to be prepended to path before starting the build on host
#   SecPath =
#   AM_source_dir = location of directory containing AM under the source directory
#   ToBeBuilt = indication of what to build
#      ALL    =  AM,SM,SCM
#      BOTH   = SM,SCM
#      AGENT  = SM
#      COMMON = SCM
#   taz_name = name of the taz file for the host platform
#   oic_taz_name = name of the Oracle Instant Client taz file for the host platform
#   taz_file_ostype = OS type indication for buildpstars indicating platform type for taz files
#   taz_file_osdir = OS directory name containing files for each platform
#
#May your builds be quick and efficient, unburdened by the decrepit ramblings of unsupported
#hardware with dubious origins.  To the abyss you foul beasts, may you never see the light of
#day until an appropriate suiter arrives bearing tidings of large fortunes to revive your fallen
#husks and usher in a new era of darkness.
